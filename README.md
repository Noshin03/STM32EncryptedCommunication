# STM32EncryptedCommunication
The design problem for this project was to implement a secure two-way communication system, for personal or confidential data to be sent. Many encryption methods already exist, some being more secure than others. For this project, we chose the tried and true RSA encryption method that relies on prime numbers for its encryption mechanism.
